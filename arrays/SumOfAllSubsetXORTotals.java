     *  1 . XOR Contribution of Each Bit:

            The XOR of a subset depends on the number of times each bit is set to 1 in the subset.
            If a bit is set in an odd number of elements in the subset, the XOR will have that bit set.
            The total sum is the sum of contributions from each bit position.
            
        2 . OR Operation to Identify Active Bits:

            The bitwise OR of all numbers in the array (total |= num) tells us which bits are ever set in any number.
            For example, [1, 3] (binary 01 and 11) â†’ OR result is 11 (binary), meaning bits 0 and 1 are set.
        3 . Counting Subsets Where a Bit is Set in XOR:

            For a bit that is set in at least one number, it will be set in the XOR of exactly half of all subsets (i.e., 2^(n-1) subsets).
            This is because each bit independently appears in half of the subsets when considering all combinations.
